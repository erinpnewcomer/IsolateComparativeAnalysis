# IsolateComparativeAnalysis

All scripts I used for general isolates comparison, like phylogenetic tree construction or strain tracking.

Guide:

s20_gubbins.sh: Will run gubbins on core_gene_alignment.aln from Panaroo. While the Gubbins literature says not to use Panaroo, I wonder if it was written for an earlier version of Panaroo, because Panaroo uses MAFFT to align. I've also seen a lot of C. diff people use this, though not sure how much that can be trusted.
